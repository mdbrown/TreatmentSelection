TreatmentSelection 1.1.3
========================
 * tweaked estimation of Var(Delta) for subcohort designs. 

TreatmentSelection 1.1.2
========================
 * added plot.type 'selection impact'. see ?plot.trtsel for more information. 

 * fixed a small bug that caused warnings when plotting a trtsel object created from providing fixed risk estimates. 

TreatmentSelection 1.1.1  
========================

 * eval.trtsel: modeled estimates of event rates calculated for subcohort designs had a bug. Calculations now are correct. 

 * eval.trtsel:  also fixed bug where event rates werent calculated when bootstraps = 0. 

 * eval.trtsel:  fixed event rate labeling bug that swapped trt all for trt none. 

 * plot.trtsel: added new plot.type that plots event rate under different marker based treatment assignment rules vs. F_delta(v).

 * plot.trtsel:  the mean trt effect line for subcohort designs was not weighted correctly. this has been fixed for continuous and discrete markers. 

 * plot.trtsel:  fixed a bug building plots for subcohort designs with discrete markers 

 * fixed various small things so that the package now has no warnings from R CMD Check

 * added manual files for tsdata_scc and tsdata_cc

 * calibrate.trtsel: fixed bug when calibrating models fit using stratified case-control data. 


TreatmentSelection 2.0.3
========================

Note: This is a large update with many changes. Although, the estimation methods remain the same, many of the functions inputs have changed. This is to accomodate multivariate models and survival outcomes. 

- Addition of 'trtsel_measures': a simple function for evaluating the performance of a user-specified marker-based treatment rule.
- Input formulas into trtsel objects instead of univariate marker information. This allows for the evaluation of multivariate models. 
- The package now allows for survival outcomes.
- Bias-correction to adjust for over-optimism that comes from evaluating models on the same data that were used to fit model parameters. `eval.trtsel` and `compare.trtsel` now implements a bootstrap bias-correction method. 

TreatmentSelection 2.0.4 
========================
- adjusted estimate of event rate under marker-based trt. 


TreatmentSelection 2.1.0
========================
Two key additions: 
- allow continuous and time-to-event outcomes 
- allow a user to evaluate models with more than one marker

One minor additions: 
- updated the estimator of event rate under marker based treatment.
