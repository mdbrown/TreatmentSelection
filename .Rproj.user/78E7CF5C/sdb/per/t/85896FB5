Markers Y1 and Y2 are candidates for identifying a subset of women with estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer who do not benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy over and above tamoxifen.  The clinical outcome of interest, termed \"event\", is 5-year breast cancer recurrence or death.  Data come from a hypothetical randomized trial where subjects are randomly assigned to tamoxifen alone or tamoxifen plus chemotherapy and followed to ascertain this outcome; markers Y1 and Y2 are measured at baseline.\n  \\describe{\n    \\item{\\code{trt}}{a numeric vector distinguishing chemotherapy-treated individuals (trt = 1) vs individuals treated with tamoxifen alone (trt = 0)}\n    \\item{\\code{event}}{a numeric vector indicating event status  (1 for recurrence or death within 5 years, 0 otherwise)}\n    \\item{\\code{Y1}}{a numeric vector of values for marker 1.
